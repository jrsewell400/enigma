# Enigma Self Evaluation

**1. Functionality: 1**
- Simply put, I did not get any of the functionality working in Enigma. :(

**2. Object Oriented Programming: 3**
- For what I did complete, I feel as though I broke my project out into logical components, and I would've continued to do so until the project was complete.  My classes are of acceptable size, and I don't believe they contain information they shouldn't know about.  Additionally, I can articulate the single responsibility of each method.

**3. Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 3**
- For conventions and mechanics, my code is indented and spaced correctly.  Only one line of code could be considered "excessively long".  My class, method, and variable names follow convention.  Most, if not all, of my enumerables are the most efficient tool.  I implemented multiple hashes in logical ways.

**4. Test Driven Development: 3**
- Per SimpleCov, my testing covers 100% of methods written.  For as far as I made it in the project, I did test for an edge case (generate_key).  My git history should show that I wrote tests before implementing code.

**5. Version Control: 3**
- Although I ended with 40+ commits, I believe there were a few that I could've waited on (blank files).  All pull requests should include logical chunks of fucntionality as I would write a test, then the method, get them to work, and then commit that work.  There shouldn't be any pull requests that include multiple pieces of functionality.
